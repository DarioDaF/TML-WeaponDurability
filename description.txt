What if weapons had durability in Terraria?

At the moment multiplayer is not considered or supported
An equivalent mod for 1.4 tML is in the works and that will probably
contain multiplayer support (cause it seems fun for standoff fights).

1.4.1 - Changed name and publish
1.4 - Fixed "projectile" guns
1.3.1 - Nerfing FlyingKnifes to be like yoyos
1.3 - Yoyo balancing and stack patch
1.2.1 - This time with less Sickles
